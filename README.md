# aOS

**Simple Operating System based on Linux kernel, built with Linux From Scratch**

*Personal project for academic use. Built from crouton Ubuntu 14.04*

## Authors

  - GARCIA Guillaume

## Development base

  - Inspired from *[Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)* PDF book versions *7.9* and **8.0**.
  - The very first version will be pure 32 bits.
  - Built from host Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 for Chromebook (using [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton)).

## Main goals

  - The very first aim of this project is to learn how a Linux based distro works.
  - It should be as light as possible, and may be used as embedded OS.
  - A specific version will be developped in order to run on a Raspeberry Pi 3, for an embbeded dashcam project for cars.

## Cross-platform future project

  - Thanks to *[Cross Linux From Scratch](http://www.fr.linuxfromscratch.org/CLFS/)*, the OS will be cross-platform (32/64 bits). Coming soon ...

## Setting up the OS

  - *Coming soon...*
